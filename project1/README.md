## Deliverables

Please compress your code file into a zipped file (firstName_lastName_hw1.zip) and submit it to Canvas.

## Grading

* policy evaluation (20 points)
* policy improvement (20 points)
* policy iteration (20 points)
* value iteration (20 points)
* rander game (20 points)

## Guidelines
* Implement functions in mdp_dp.py
* Evaluate functions by typing "nosetests -v mdp_dp_test.py" (put mdp_dp.py and mdp_dp_test.py in the same folder)
